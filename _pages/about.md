I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Cyber Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Prior to this, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics, Physics, and Fundamental Science from the Yingcai Honors College at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2021. Additionally, I was selected as one of the 40 students out of 4,000 to join the Liren Class at UESTC in 2018, a program specifically designed to cultivate leadership skills. 

Now I am now supervised by Prof. Nenghai Yu in USTC and Jieping Ye (IEEE Fellow), Le Lu (IEEE Fellow) in Alibaba Group. Prior to this, I was supervised by Prof. Lixin Duan from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC from 2019 to 2021.

I have published about 10 first-author papers at top conferences and journals, including EMNLP, AAAI, IJCAI, ACM MM, TCSVT, TGRS etc. My research interest covers natural language processing (LLM in particular) and image segmentation/detection. In recent years, I primarily focused on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology to interdisciplinary researches, such as remote sensing and medical images, in hopes of allowing AI to empower various fields. Also, I am keen on exploreing the integration of physical and mathematical principles to design innovative neural network architectures, aiming to merge artificial intelligence with scientific disciplines in a groundbreaking way.
