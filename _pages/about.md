I'm now persuing my Ph.D. degree in [School of Cyber Science and Technology](https://cybersec.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). Before that I received my B.S. in mathematics, physics and fundamental science from [Yingcai Honors College](https://www.yingcai.uestc.edu.cn/?n=zp.front.front.listpage&catid=52&team=&professionaltitle=%E5%89%AF%E6%95%99%E6%8E%88&headword=n) at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2021.

I am now supervised by [Prof. Nenghai Yu](https://dsxt.ustc.edu.cn/zj_js.asp?zzid=728) in USTC and Jieping Ye (FIEEE), Le Lu (FIEEE) in Alibaba Group. Prior to this, I was supervised by [Prof. Lixin Duan](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/lxduan/zh_CN/index.htm) from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC from 2019 to 2021.

I have published about 10 first-author & corresponding author papers at top conferences and journals. My research interest covers natural language processing and computer vision. In recent years, I primarily focused on applying artificial intelligence (AI) technology to interdisciplinary researches (Medical Image, Remote Sensing...) in hopes of allowing AI to empower various fields. Also, I am keen on exploreing the integration of physical and mathematical principles to design innovative neural network architectures, aiming to merge artificial intelligence with scientific disciplines in a groundbreaking way.

Besides research, I love wines & cocktails, TF & FREDERIC MALLE's Eau de Parfum and many Cantonese songs. Life and research should be aparted, right?
